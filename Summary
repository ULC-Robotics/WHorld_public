This document summarizes what all the scripts do:

triage_repertoire_dp.py:
- Process raw depths profiles to generate artificial state dive profiles

IR_read_files.py
- functions that import poipu/caperace/princeville/tng visual observation data
- data consists of distances where animals where detected
- from histograms, made curves of probability of detection as a function of distance from ship

main_function.py
- contains main code, where whales and ships detection are counted during a run time

MAIN.py
- function to call to run entire model.
- it extracts & load cases to run from excel sheet, calls main_function.py to do the detection, and save results.

 whale_func.py:
 - contains function to create whale trajectories

 ship_func.py
 - contains function to create ship trajectories

##PLOT
plot_main_func.py:
- function used in main model to plot WHorld hit detections and probabilities

plot_whale_speed_variations:
- contains functions to extract probability data from runs
- use data to graph impact of varying ship speeds on in time detection probability, for different detection range, reaction time

plot_superplot:
- gather all the data from runs to graph mega plot of in time prob as a function of all parameters

plt_rt_behaviorsvs_speed.py
- graph many little plots about probability for specific parameters
